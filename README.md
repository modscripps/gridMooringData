# gridMooringData

Matlab toolbox for gridding and analyzing mooring data. Originally written by Zhongxiang Zhao to work with McLane Profiler moorings. Further developments and generalizations, as well as git version control, implemented by Olavo Badaro Marques.

This toolbox has three main features:

* You can load all the data from a mooring.
* Grid the data in a common depth-time grid.
* Compute quantities of interest when studying internal waves from mooring data (e.g. normal mode decomposition).

A few important remarks to bear in mind:

* The data MUST be saved following standards of the Multiscale Ocean Dynamics (MOD) group.
